          <h2>College Student Life:</h2>
          <p>College life is a significant milestone in a student's journey. It's a time of transition, growth, and self-discovery. While it can be an exciting and liberating experience, it also comes with its own set of challenges.</p>

          <h2>You’re all in the same boat</h2>
          <p>One thing to remember is that everyone starting college is in the same position as you! You are all new and will all have the same questions going through your mind the first week. No one will be any wiser than you when it comes to things like where lessons are, or how to use your student ID card.</p>

          <h2>Making new friends</h2>
          <p>College is a great time to make new friends. While you may be starting college with some of your secondary school friends, there will also be people in your classes that you don’t know. Speaking to new people can be daunting but you already know you have something in common with them if they’re in your class; you picked the same subject to study! Just smile and introduce yourself to start a friendly conversation.</p>
